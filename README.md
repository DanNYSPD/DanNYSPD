- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanNYSPD| FullStack Developer | Web Senior Developer| Linux | Backend Developer| Vue developer
- 👀 I’m interested in developing interesting and useful projects, especially web projects as a fullstack developer, I like to improve things with new ideas, features, better architecture, code design, patterns, and practices. Something that I  enjoy to find ways to make things easier, less prone to errors, and more understandable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to lead and manage others because I realize that besides tech skills it's important to coordinate and communicate activities effectively to get the job done. Respect, constant communication, mutual feedback, and insight understanding are the keys to good team collaboration. In tech, I'm constantly learning many things not with a study plan but how that knowledge is interesting or how useful it is for my current and future projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make me feel excited and proud, work with great teams in an awesome culture, and applying new technologies.
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn, sorry If I'm not so active in this social network but I will answer as soon as I notice your message.
